## When does a physical system compute?

From my understanding this paper tries to explain, through a collection of researches, when is a physical system computing. This included even biological and quantum computers which I plan to source further research papers on. 

The links between abstract and physical levels of computing are clearly shown in diagrams throughout paper which really helped. From what I understand these show the conditions needed for a physical system to be ‘computing’. A couple of the sections in this paper try to explain how representation relation works. I feel it went over when it was used rather than how it works most of the time leaving me with only a basic idea of how it works (taking something abstract to represent something physical).

As a whole I found the paper very hard to understand at first. However, after ready it a couple times more I now understand more part especially section 11 “Non-standard computing: computation or experiment?”. Another thought of mine was that this paper seems so in depth it doesn’t allow for any interpretation of our own even though it’s just a theory trying to give some groundwork on the subject.

## Experimental Investigation of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in programming

Having read through the whole paper i found that the research was very thorough through conducting many experiments in each area of computing multiple times. This was also clearly set out for readers with sections for each. Alongside this the use of statistics and diagrams benefit the findings of the Schiederman's results and helps him get the information across much more easily. 

However i believe the main bulk of the paper was trying to convince readers that users of flowcharts in programming will be more successful and cut down on the amount of bugs they encountered. This did not result in the predicted outcome though as results were very similar so more research could be done.

As a conclusion to the paper though Scheiderman presents his findings but does not set anything in stone. Instead the paper ends very open with the evidence from the experiments being reviewed. I believe this is because the results and statistics gathered were not very conclusive or favoured to support either side of the question whether the use of flowcharts assist users that much more than those who do not use them.

## A Fast Procedure for computing the Distance between Complex Object in Three- Dimensional Space

MY initial thoughts after attempting to read this paper were very mixed. I believe the idea of this paper is trying to clarify the complex algorithm which calculates the distance between two objects in 3D space to something more simple. However I came across no conclusion making this more difficult. 

## Go to statement considered harmful

My thoughts after reading his paper were that is was a very strongly opinionated paper on how Go To statements should be abolished in higher level programming. This makes sense due to readability which is very important in programming. With Go To statements this can make the code skip to different parts making it, according to the paper, very unnecessary and "has an immediate conseuquence". Having no go to statements also makes code more maintainable so you can see why the point is being made.

## Summary linking all the papers

I believe these papers are all looking onwards on how to make Computing more efficient and trying to gain knowledge of how computing will progress. For example, Scheinderman is trying to support the claim that flowcharts will assist with programming errors, whereas the fourth paper is trying to eliminate go to statements as a way of progressing. Almost all papers I came across have the same mindset of what is going to more efficient through experiments and findings.
