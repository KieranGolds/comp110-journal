From my understanding this paper tries to explain, through a collection of researches, when is a physical system computing. This included even biological and quantum computers which I plan to source further research papers on. 

The links between abstract and physical levels of computing are clearly shown in diagrams throughout paper which really helped. From what I understand these show the conditions needed for a physical system to be ‘computing’. A couple of the sections in this paper try to explain how representation relation works. I feel it went over when it was used rather than how it works most of the time leaving me with only a basic idea of how it works (taking something abstract to represent something physical).

As a whole I found the paper very hard to understand at first. However, after ready it a couple times more I now understand more part especially section 11 “Non-standard computing: computation or experiment?”. Another thought of mine was that this paper seems so in depth it doesn’t allow for any interpretation of our own even though it’s just a theory trying to give some groundwork on the subject.
